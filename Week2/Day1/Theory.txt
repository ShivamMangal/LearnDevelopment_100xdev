->Synchronous
Synchronous means the code runs in a particular sequence of instructions given in the program.
Each instruction waits for the previous instruction to complete its execution.

->Asynchronous
Due to synchronous programming, sometimes imp instructions get blocked due to some previous instructions, which causes a delay in the Ul.
Asynchronous code execution allows to execute next instructions immediately and doesn't block the flow.

->Callback Hell
Callback Hell : Nested callbacks stacked below one another forming a pyramid structure. (Pyramid of Doom)
This style of programming becomes difficult to understand & manage.
